# venturehacks-seed â€” the seed for the VentureHacks basic tech session


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the webapp-starter repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

Have installed:
- node
- npm
- git

### Clone webapp-starter

Clone the webapp-starter repository using [git][git]:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venture-hacks/webapp-starter.git
cd webapp-starter
```

If you just want to start a new project without the commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/venturehacks/webapp-starter.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

* We get the development and server side tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

```bash
npm install
npm install -g bower
bower install
```

You should find that you have two new folders in your project. Let me know if you do not.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework and client-side dependency files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
webapp-starter changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  components/           --> all app specific modules
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
```

## To Run App

We will write the server to handle small functions on the backend and serve the Angular app on port 8080.

```node
node server.js
```
